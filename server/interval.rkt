;An interval is the minimum time in between requests from an agent.
;The interval is  measured from the last time a request was processed.

(define (make-interval) (measure-from 0))

;An agent can be active only once every 100 milliseconds.
;The interval calculates the @bold{delay} required until the next request time.

(test-case:

   (define (check-values calculate expected-delay expected-next)
     (let-values ([(delay next) (calculate)])
       (check-= delay expected-delay .001)

      (check-values (位 () (delay 1000 1100)) 0 1100))

;The delay is calculated as the difference from now to the last active time plus 100 milliseconds.
;The next active time is now plus the delay.

;To @bold{measure from} the last active time, the @racket[current-inexact-milliseconds] function is used to calculate the delay.
;The @racket[sleep] function takes a time in seconds, so the delay is divided by 1000.
;The return value is a @racket[measure-from] function to be used for the next interval.
