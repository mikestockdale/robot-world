;Gathering is a modification of the wandering strategy.
;The bots start adjacent to a base.
;The bots still wander randomly, taking blocks when they find them, but they bring them to their starting location to transfer them to the base.
;It's the first strategy to accomplish a basic goal.

;The strategy keeps track of the current direction each bot is facing.
;It has a destination location, where the blocks are transfered.
