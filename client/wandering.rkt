;Wandering is a strategy where bots wander randomly, taking blocks when they find them, and dropping them nearby other blocks.
;This results in blocks being grouped into clusters.

;Of course, this isn't really a strategy, and at this point the game does not have any goals that a strategy can pursue anyway.
;It is a partial copy of the current strategy in the orginal version of the game.
;Its main purpose is as an example, to help evolve the structure of the game.

;The strategy keeps track of the current direction each bot is facing.
;To avoid repeatedly taking and dropping the same block, it also maintains a delay in between these actions.
