;Gathering is a modification of the wandering strategy.
;The bots still wander randomly, taking blocks when they find them, but they bring them to a fixed location to drop them.
;This results in blocks being grouped more rapidly into a single cluster.
;Its purpose is as an second example, to help evolve the structure of the game.

;The strategy keeps track of the current direction each bot is facing.
;To avoid repeatedly taking and dropping the same block, it also maintains a delay in between these actions.
;It has a destination location, where the blocks are gathered.
